        After saving the universe multiple times, I found myself in a dark but all to familiar place.
        Huddled up in my little Scandanavian hovel, having one too many ales, my place... like myself, unwashed and unkept.
        Bumming around with my friends, just watching tv and losing my temper for losing in a video game... Sorry NoobMaster69... the pandemic was hard for everyone and for me as well. With no call for hero work I felt I needed a change...
        That's why I was elated to find The Odin Project! They're self-paced curriculumn gave me all the time I needed to learn something new and unfamiliar.
        Not all heroes wear capes... well I do but I'm glad I've decided to invest in myself and learn web development. 
        It's another tool under my toolbelt and a worthy companion to Mjölnir, giving me a newfound sense of pride and accomplishment along with my hero work. So what are you waiting for? If I can learn to be a web dev hero so can you! With Odin as your guide you'll be in worthy company and well on your way down the path.
